This project demonstrates unit testing in C# using NUnit, with a focus on testing an employee payroll library. The `Payroll_Lib` library is managed as a **NuGet package** dependency, which simplifies installation and versioning.

## Features
- Example unit tests for validating employee attributes, salary calculations, phone/IBAN validation, and more.
- Uses **NUnit** for organizing and running tests.
- Demonstrates the use of a custom library (`Payroll_Lib`) as a **NuGet package** for easy integration.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Restore the NuGet packages (Visual Studio will automatically restore `Payroll_Lib` and other dependencies).
4. Run the tests using the Test Explorer in Visual Studio.

## Dependencies
- **NUnit** for unit testing.
- **Payroll_Lib** library (installed via NuGet).
